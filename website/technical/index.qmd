        # Verify physical distance through network paths
        paths = measure_network_paths(peer_info)
        if not verify_path_diversity(paths):
            return False
            
        # Check latency corresponds to geographic distance
        latency = measure_min_latency(peer_info)
        if not verify_physical_latency(latency, peer_info.location):
            return False
            
        # Validate infrastructure ownership

### State Management Implementation

The state management system uses a modified Merkle-Patricia trie optimized for geographic distribution:

```python

        shard = self.get_geographic_shard(location)
        
        # Update state with location metadata
        state_update = {
            'value': value,
            'location': location,
            'timestamp': get_network_time(),
            'validators': get_regional_validators(location)
        }
        
        # Update state tree with geographic indexing
